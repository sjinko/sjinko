### Hi, my name is [Shin Alexandre Koseki](https://shinkoseki.com) 

I am an urban designer, policy-maker, coder, co-founder of the Paris-based urban planning cooperative [Chôros](https://choros.place), and co-founder of the European digital cooperative Data Think! My work links urban planning, social theory and new digital research practices in social science and the humanities.

Starting septembre 2020, I head **Happenned**, a transdisciplinary research project hosted by Max-Planck Society’s Center for Digital Visual Studies and Bibliotheca Hertziana.  **Happenned** provides insight on the intersection of landscape history, visual arts, politics and urban development in early modern Rome.

As part of my recent research activities, I worked with the French Ministry of Education on the geography of academic success, and the French Ministry of Agriculture on citizens’ aspirations on the future of food, landscape and the environment. In 2019-2020, I was scientific observer at the French Citizen Convention for Climate, extending my scientific and personal interest for new forms of democratic practices. 

Since 2018, I am the scientific coordinator of the EPFL–University of Lausanne’s Center for Digital Humanities and the EPFL Digital Habitat Cluster. Before, I was postdoctoral fellow at MIT and the ETH Zürich, where I developed research concerned with analyzing geographic patterns of political polarization using network science.

I hold a PhD in City Science and a MSc in Architecture from EPFL.
